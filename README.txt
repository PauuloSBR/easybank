EasyBank Landing Page

I'm starting this project to train my skills in HTML, CSS/Sass, and Typescript. It's a simple landing page for a fantasy bank named EasyBank. 
The page is responsive and works well on mobile devices.The main purpose of this project is to improve my skills in developing layouts.

I found this challenge on frontendmentor.io, a website that helps improve your frontend skills. The site provides images and a model of the site to work from.
